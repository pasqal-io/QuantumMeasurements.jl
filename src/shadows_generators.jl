    generate_classical_shadows(state, R; noise_model, rng)

Return an array of `R` classical shadows of `state` that can be used to estimate the expected value of any observable.

# Arguments

  - `state::AbstractRegister`: a quantum state given as a Yao register. Usually constructed
    using a Yao block like so.
    
    ```julia
    s = zero_state(2)
    block = chain(3.1 * kron(X, Y), put(1 => H), -0.3 * kron(Z, Z))
    apply!(block, s)
    ```
  - `R::Int` : the desired number of classical shadows.

# Keywords

  - `noise_model::Noise`: use this keyword to make measurements noisy. No noise is applied to
    measurements if unspecified. Functions from the file noise.jl generate common noise_model functions.
  - `rng::AbstractRNG`: use this keyword to see the measurement process with a given random
    number generator for repeatable results. It defaults on `GLOBAL_RNG` if unspecified.

# Returns

  - `Array{Shadow}`: An array of `R` classical shadows of the `state`.

Return an array of classical shadows of `state` that can be used to estimate the expected value of some observables.

for a set of `M` observables that are `k` local.

  - `M::Int`: The number of observables which expected values will be estimated using these classical shadows.
  - `precision::Float64`: the approximate additive error of the predicitons with respect to
